## Privacy Practices
### Single purpose
Automatically closes Slack redirect pages and restores focus to the tab you were on beforehand. Supports Slack archive pages and app redirect pages.
### Permission justification
This extension is limited to only run on specific slack.com pages that are redirect pages (archives/* and app_redirect*), because those are the pages that we show the countdown timer on.
